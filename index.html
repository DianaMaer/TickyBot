           <p>TickyBot is a Slack Bot ü§ñ that lets you use support tickets on Slack. This way, you don't need to leave your beloved channel to assist your users, if you don't feel like it.</p>
           <p>With TickyBot you can easily check if you've received new tickets, change their status, or write a reply, and the ticket will instantly update itself on our site.</p>
       </div>
       <p>Support requests shouldn't be handled through Slack's direct messages. </p>
       <p>Image about someone asking silly questions and the workplace admin asking him/her to open a support ticket so other admins could look into the issue.</p>
